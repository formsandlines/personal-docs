* General infos

NetLogo bundles a Java Runtime
- see [[http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/faq.html#why-does-netlogo-bundle-java][Why does NetLogo bundle Java?]]
- location: =NetLogo X.X.X/runtime/=
- Java 17.0.4 (for NetLogo 6.3)
- to use a different runtime, open =NetLogo.cfg= and set ~app.runtime~ property to
  its path (at own risk)

* Key differences to other Logos

[[http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html#compared-to-other-logos][Source]]

Focus on *agent-based modelling*.

*Lexical scoping* of local variables and inputs instead of /dynamic scoping/.

*Anonymous procedures* are true /lexically-scoped closures/.

NetLogo is a *Lisp 1* (only one namespace for procedures and other symbols).
- contrary to classic [[file:logo.org][Logo]]

No *word data type*, instead NetLogo uses /strings/ in most cases where words
would be used in Logo.
- e.g. ~"see spot run"~ or ~["see" "spot" "run"]~ instead of ~[see spot run]~

Definition of *operations* (called /reporter procedures/ in NetLogo):
- ~to-report~ with ~report~ instead of ~to~ with ~output~

*Procedure inputs* are enclosed in square brackets.
- e.g. ~to square [x]~

No interactive definition of procedures.

*Variables* are defined and used with just the name (no colons or quotes).
- the special form ~set~ is used (which doesn’t evaluate its first input)
  instead of a ~make~ command
- as a result, /procedures/ and /variables/ occupy a single shared namespace

*Infix math operators* have /lower precedence/ than reporters with names:
- e.g. ~sin x + 1~ = ~(sin x) + 1~ instead of ~sin (x + 1)~ (other Logos)

*Boolean reporters* ~and~ and ~or~ are /special forms/ and /short-circuit/.

NetLogo’s ~run~ command works on /anonymous procedures/ and /strings/ instead of
/lists/ and does not permit the (re)definition of procedures.

*Control structures* (like ~if~ and ~while~) are /special forms/, not ordinary
functions.

* Development style

Names
- most models have a “setup” and a “go” button, but it is not required
- boolean variables should end in a question mark

Documentation
- write the *documentation* alongside the model, to keep them in sync
- write *pseudocode* for each main procedure in the documentation (e.g. under
  “how it works”) to help non-programmers understand how the model works

Reproducability
- use ~random-seed~ to be able to *reproduce* a particular behavior that results
  from calls to various ~random~ procedures
- store interesting results in *preset configurations* which a user can load
  by clicking a corresponding button and then ~go~
  - see library model “Heroes and Cowards” for an example
- see [[https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html#random-numbers][Random numbers (docs)]]

#+begin_src netlogo
to preset [ seed ]
  ;; set constant model parameters
  set … …
  ;; set the seed of the pseudo-random number generator
  random-seed seed
  setup
end
#+end_src

* Variables

Define *global variables* (first code line):
: globals [ <varname> … ]

Define *local variables* for an /agentset/ to add custom properties to agents:
: turtles-own [ <varname> … ]

Set value of a variable:
: set <name> <value>

* Procedures

Define a /procedure/ (no return value):
: to my-function [<param> …]
:   <instruction>
:   …
: end

Define a /reporter procedure/ (returns/reports a value):
: to-report my-function [<param> …]
:   <instruction>
:   …
:   report <return-value>
: end

Common procedures that most models define are ~setup~ and ~go~. ~setup~ initializes
the model and ~go~ creates its next state.
- write ~clear-all~ as a first instruction in ~setup~ to reset the model

~startup~ is a special routine that runs when the model loads, before ~setup~.
- can be useful to load data from files

: to startup
:   …
:   setup
: end

* General commands

Just like in UCBLogo:
: print
: se / sentence <str/list> <str/list>
: word <str> <str>

* Math

: max <list>
: min <list>

Report statistical mean of numbers in given ~list~:
: mean <list>
- ignores non-numeric items
- same as ~sum <list> / count <list>~

: round <float>
: precision <float> <dec-places>

* Randomness

Set the seed of the pseudo-random number generator:
: random-seed <int>
Generate/report a new seed for use with ~random-seed~:
: new-seed

Pick a random number up to ~n~:
: random <int n>
: random-float <float n>

Report a number from a random /normal distribution/:
: random-normal <mean> <std-deviation>

Report a number from a random /exponential distribution/:
: random-exponential <mean>

* Iteration

: repeat <n> [ <instruction> … ]

Run ~command~ for each item of the ~list~:
: foreach <list> <command>
: (foreach <list1> … <command>)
- ~command~ -> name of a command or an anonymous command created with ~->~
  - in previous NetLogo versions, the symbol ~?~ in ~command~ refers to the
    current iterated item, now it needs to be ~[? -> …]~
- with multiple ~list~'s, runs ~command~ for each group of items from each list
  - all lists must be the same length

* Control structures

Run the instructions from the first /true/ condition:
: ifelse <cond> [ <instruction> … ] [ <else-instruction> … ]
Can be used like a ~switch~ statement:
: (ifelse
:   <cond1> [ <instruction> … ]
:   <cond2> [ <instruction> … ]
:   [ <else-instruction> … ])

Report the value reported from the first /true/ condition:
: ifelse-value <cond> [ <reporter> ] [ <else-reporter> ]
Can be used like a ~cond~ statement:
: (ifelse-value
:   <cond1> [ <reporter1> ]
:   <cond2> [ <reporter2> ]
:   [ <else-reporter> ])


* Data structures

** Strings

** Lists

Like Logo:
: length <list>
: first <list>
: last <list>
: but-first <list>
: but-last <list>
: item <index> <list>

Report a list of length ~size~ containing values according to ~reporter~:
: n-values <size> <reporter>
- ~reporter~ -> anonymous reporter or the name of a reporter
  - may accept an input, the 0-based index of the current item
- fractional ~size~ will be rounded down to nearest int

Pick a random member of ~list~:
: one-of <list>

Check if /x/ is a member of /y/:
: member? <value> <list>
: member? <string1> <string2>
: member? <agent> <agentset>

Report a section of ~list~ defined ~from~ (incl.) index ~to~ (excl.) index:
: sublist <list> <from> <to>
- indexes start at 0
- fractional indexes are rounded down to nearest int

Report a new list with ~item~ prepended to ~list~:
: fput <item> <list>

** Agentsets

*Note:* the /special Agentsets/ (~turtles~, ~links~ and the “breed” agentsets) /grow
automatically/ as new agents are being added. This doesn’t apply to other
agentsets like those created with ~with~ or the ~turtle-set~ and ~link-set~
primitives.
- the content of normal agentsets will only change if the agents that they
  contain /die/

*** Built-in
- ~patches~, ~turtles~, ~links~
- ~no-turtles~ (empty agentset)
- ~turtles-here~, ~in-link-neighbors~

*** Breeds

: breed [ <breeds-name> <breed-name> ]

Example:
: breed [ mice mouse ]
: ask one-of turtles [ set breed mice ]
: ask mice [ set color white ]

*** Create from

Report an agentset containing all turtles in the input(s):
: turtle-set <value>
: (turtle-set <value> …)
- inputs may be individual turtles, turtle agentsets, nobody, or lists (or
  nested lists) containing any of the above
- can be used to combine multiple agentsets (like a union)

*** Select

If a single agent was not found, a reporter reports ~nobody~ as a special
value.

all:
: <agentset>
one specific member:
: <agent id>
one random member:
: one-of <agentset>
/n/ random members:
: n-of <size> <agentset>
up to /n/ random members:
: up-to-n-of <size> <agentset>
excluding self:
: other <agentset>

filtered by condition:
: <agentset> with [<condition>]
exclude a specific agent:
: <agentset> with [not (self = <agent id>)]

all turtles on given patch(es) or on same patch as given turtle(s):
: turtles-on <agent / agentset>
: <breeds>-on <agent / agentset>

*** Sort
Report a list of agents, sorted according to each agent’s value for
~reporter~:
: sort-on [ <reporter> ] <agentset>
- e.g. ~sort-on [ size ] turtles~

*** Report

Report a specific property:
: [<property>] of <agentset>

: member? …


** Agents

*** Observer

**** Model

Remove model (agents and their state):
: ca / clear-all

**** Ticks

Reset counter:
: reset-ticks
- typically used in ~setup~ procedure as last instruction

Increment counter:
: tick
- typically used in ~run~ procedure as last instruction

**** Populations

Generate ~n~ turtles:
: crt / create-turtles <n> ?[ <ask-instr> … ]
- with optional ~ask~ instructions for generated turtles

Count agentset:
: count <agentset>
- agentsets can be ~turtles~, ~patches~, etc.

Apply instructions …
… to all agents of a set:
: ask <agentset> [ <instruction> … ]
… to a specific agent:
: ask <agent> ?<index> [ <instruction> … ]
- right-click on agents in view area to lookup their index
- e.g. ~ask turtle 1 …~ or ~ask patch -2 4 …~
… to one random agent:
: ask one-of <agentset> [ <instruction> … ]

Create dynamic agentset:
: let my-agentset turtles with [ … ] <?instruction>

Inspect an agent (opens inspect window):
: inspect <agent>

*** Turtles

**** Lifecycle
Remove turtles:
: die

Clone a turtle ~n~ times with optional ~instructions~:
: hatch <n> [ <instruction> … ]
: hatch-<breeds> <n> [ <instruction> … ]

**** Properties
Use with ~show~ or ~set~.

Turtle id:
: who  :: int
- starts from 0

Turtle (shape) color:
: color   :: name/int
- e.g. names like ~blue~ or integers like ~2~ (grayscale)

Turtle (shape) size:
: size   :: int

Turtle shape:
: shape   :: string
- e.g. ~"person"~

: set-default-shape <agentset> <shape>

Turtle x/y-coordinates:
: xcor : ycor   :: int
- generate random coordinates with:
  : random-xcor : random-ycor
- set both coordinates at the same time:
  : setxy <xpos> <ypos>

Turtle heading:
: heading   :: int

Turtle label:
: label   :: string

Turtle visibility:
: hidden?  :: boolean

Patch where turtle is located:
: patch-here   :: Patch

Visibility of trace (“pen”) left behind:
: pen-mode  :: "up" | "down" | "erase"
- influenced by ~pen-up~, ~pen-down~ and ~pen-erase~

Stroke weight of trace left behind:
: pen-size  :: int


Examples:
#+begin_src netlogo
; labels with coordinates:
ask turtles [
  set label (word precision xcor 2 ", " precision ycor 2)
]
#+end_src

**** Movement
Forward/backward movement:
: fd / forward <n>
: back <n>

Left/right rotation:
: lt / left <degrees> : rt / right <degrees>

Set x/y coordinates to the same as the given ~agent~:
: move-to <agent>
- if ~agent~ is a patch, moves to its center
- heading is unaltered

Rotate to align heading with an x/y-point:
: facexy <x> <y>

Align heading with another ~agent~:
: face <agent>

Report heading from this agent towards an x/y-point:
: towardsxy <x> <y>

Report heading from this agent towards another ~agent~:
: towards <agent>
- *Note:* ~set heading towards <agent>~ may /not/ be the same as ~face <agent>~ as
  mentioned in the [[https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#towards][docs]]

Report distance from this agent to another ~agent~:
: distance <agent>

Show/hide/erase movement trace (turtle-only):
: pu / pen-up
: pd / pen-down
: pe / pen-erase
Erase movement traces:
: cd / clear-drawing

**** Links

Create a single/multiple link(s):
: create-link… : create-links…
- ~-with …~ -> undirected link with …
- ~-to …~ -> directed link to …
- ~-from …~ -> directed link from …

Examples:
: create-link-with one-of other turtles
- ~one-of~ -> select one random agent
- ~other~ -> remove myself from the set


Report the /agentset/ of all turtles on the other end of any links
connected to this turtle:
: link-neighbors


*** Patches

Share (~n~ × 100) percent of the value from a ~patch-variable~ equally to all
8 neighbors of the patch (“diffuse” it):
: diffuse <patch-variable> <n>
- ~n~ must be between 0 and 1
- observer command, not a patch command!
- use ~diffuse4~ if there are only four neighbors

**** Properties

Patch color:
: pcolor   :: name/int

Patch x/y-coordinates:
: pxcor : pycor   :: int
- generate random coordinates with:
  : random-pxcor : random-pycor

Patch label:
: plabel   :: string

*** Links

**** Properties

Connected agents:
: end1 : end2   :: agent
- for /directed links/, ~end1~ is the *“root agent”* and ~end2~ the *“leaf agent”*

Link shape:
: shape   :: string

Link thickness:
: thickness   :: float
- use values < 1.0

How the link ties its agents together:
: tie-mode   :: "fixed" | "none" | "free"
- set to ~"fixed"~ with ~tie~ command
- set to ~"none"~ with ~untie~ command
- set to ~"free"~ with ~set tie-mode "free"~

~"fixed"~ / ~"free"~ : ~end1~ and ~end2~ are tied together
- for /undirected links/, if one of them moves, the other will be dragged
  along with same distance and direction
- for /directed links/, only when ~end1~ (root agent) moves, ~end2~ (leaf
  agent) will also move along
- the only difference between ~"fixed"~ and ~"free"~ is that with ~"free"~ the
  heading of the /leaf turtle/ remains unchanged if the /root turtle/
  changes its heading

**** Creation

Tie ~end1~ and ~end2~ of the link together:
: tie
- sets ~tie-mode~ to ~"fixed"~
- can be used to create *Meta-Agents*

Untie the ~tie~'d link:
: untie
- sets ~tie-mode~ to ~"none"~


Examples:
: ask link 0 1 [ tie ]
: ask turtle 0 [ create-link-to turtle 1 [ tie ] ]

* Plotting

To be used in a *monitor* UI component.

Clear all the plots:
: clear-all-plots

Increment ~x~-value of the plot pen by ~plot-pen-interval~, then plot a point at
the updated ~x~-value and the given ~y~-value:
: plot <y>
- initially, ~x~ is set to 0

Move the current plot pen to point ~x~ ~y~:
: plotxy <x> <y>
- if the pen is down, a line, bar or point will be drawn (depending on the
  pen’s mode)

Report the min/max value of the x or y axis of the current plot:
: plot-x-min : plot-x-max
: plot-y-min : plot-y-max

* Timer

~timer~ is a global variable that measures the time since execution.
- can be used to measure performance (turn off ~view updates~ for more accurate
  results)

Reset the ~timer~:
: reset-timer

* unsorted

: myself
: nobody
: turtles-at <x> <y>

Report a shade of ~color~ proportional to the value of ~number~:
: scale-color <color> <number> <range1> <range2>
- if ~range1 <= range2~, scale is /darker -> lighter/ (greater ~number~)
- if ~range1 > range2~, scale is inverted /darker <- lighter/ (smaller ~number~)

Use “Color Swatches” to see all available colors and scales.
: show n-values 11 [i -> list i scale-color blue i 0 10]
* Layouts

: layout-circle <agentset> <radius>
: layout-circle <list-of-turtles> <radius>

: layout-radial <turtle-set> <link-set> <root-agent>

: layout-spring <turtle-set> <link-set> <spring-constant> <spring-length> <repulsion-constant>

: layout-tutte <turtle-set> <link-set> <radius>

Examples:
: layout-radial turtles links one-of turtles
: repeat 200 [ layout-spring turtles links 0.2 5 1 ]

** BehaviorSpace

- open from ~Menubar -> Tools -> BehaviorSpace~
- create a new experiment
- run the experiment

Runs a model multiple times with specified parameters and records the
results in various output formats (tables, etc.) to be analyzed by other
tools such as /R/.
** R extension

Related: [[file:r-lang.org][Docs/r-lang]]

Pre-installed with NetLogo
- [[https://github.com/NetLogo/R-Extension]]

Doesn’t seem to work right now:
- see https://github.com/NetLogo/R-Extension/issues/27
- use the [[Simple R extension]] instead

*** Simple R extension

Needs to be installed via Extensions tool
- [[https://github.com/NetLogo/SimpleR-Extension]]

: extensions [ sr ]

Create an *R session* that the extension will use to execute code:
: sr:setup
- must be run before running any other R extension primitive:


*NOTE:* select ~Pop-out interpreter~ from the ~Simple RExtension~ menu to just
type R commands interactively. Use the ~print(…)~ command to pretty-print
output in the NetLogo console (as it would appear in R).


*Run* an ~R-statement~ in the current session:
: sr:run "<R-statement>"
: (… "<R-statement1>" "<R-statement2>" …)
- multiple strings will be interpreted as seperate R code lines
- can be used to create internal R variables or print stuff

*Evaluate* an ~R-expression~ and report the result:
: sr:runresult "<R=expression>"
- attempts to convert R data types to NetLogo data types
  - see https://github.com/NetLogo/SimpleR-Extension#srrunresult for
    conversion infos

Set a *variable* ~r-varname~ in the R session to given ~NetLogo value~:
: sr:set "<rvarname>" <NetLogo value>
- NetLogo objects will be converted to R objects as expected
  - see [[https://github.com/NetLogo/SimpleR-Extension#srset]] for conversion
    infos


Create a new *named list* in R with given ~r-varname~ to represent a single
*agent/agentset* with given properties:
: sr:set-agent "<r-varname>" <agent-or-agentset> <agent-varname>
: (… <agent-varname1> <agent-varname2> …)

Create a new *data frame* in R with given ~r-varname~ to represent an *agentset*
with given properties:
: sr:set-agent-data-frame "<r-varname>" <agents> <agent-varname>
: (… <agent-varname1> <agent-varname2> …)
- /columns/ are names of agent properties
- /rows/ represent each agent in the set

Create a new *data frame* in R with given ~r-varname~:
: sr:set-data-frame "<r-varname>" "<colname>" <list-or-anything>
: (… "<colname1>" <list-or-anything1>  "<colname2>" <list-or-anything2> …)

Create a new *list* in R with given ~r-varname~:
: sr:set-list "<r-varname>" <anything>
: (… <anything1> <anything2> …)

Create a new *named list* in R with given ~r-varname~:
: sr:set-named-list "<r-varname>" "<colname>" <list-or-anything>
: (… "<colname1>" <list-or-anything1>  "<colname2>" <list-or-anything2>)


Activate the *visual plot device* for R:
: sr:set-plot-device
- opens a window if not already open

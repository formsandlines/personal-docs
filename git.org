* Concepts

** Repository
*** .git folder
The file structure of =.git= looks like this:
: .git/
: |-- hooks/
: |-- info/
: |-- logs/
: |-- objects/
: |-- refs/
: |-- COMMIT_EDITMSG
: |-- config
: |-- description
: |-- HEAD
: |-- index

*** bare repository
A *bare* repository is essentially a =.git= folder with a specific folder
where all the project files reside.
- the directory where ~git init --bare~ was called /is/ the =.git= folder
- the directory name should have the ending ~.git~
- it has the exact same file structure as =/.git= in a non-bare repo

It doesn’t have a working tree, so nothing can be tracked and no commits
can be made.

It is only possible to [[git push]] to and [[git clone]] from a bare repository.

*** Cloning
*** Forking
** Commit
** Head
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304087/what-is-head-in-git
- a head is a reference to a commit object
- every head has a name (branch name, tag name, etc.)
- ~HEAD~ is the current (checkout) branch
- if ~HEAD~ does not point to a head (but instead e.g. to a commit id), it is
  a "detached HEAD"

Show HEAD:
: $ cat .git/HEAD

: `~`, `^` and `@`:
see https://www.golinuxcloud.com/git-head-caret-vs-tilde-at-sign-examples/

: `<rev>^<n>`            > points to the nth parent of a commit object
: `<rev>^` == `<rev>^1`  > points to the first parent of a commit
: `<rev>^0`              > is the commit itself
: `<commit ref>~`        > points to the first parent in the commit history
: `HEAD~` == `HEAD^`
: `@`                    > by itself is an alias for HEAD
: `<rev>@{n}`
: `<rev>^@`              > lists all parents of a commit object

** Branch
*** switching / checkout
Git prevents switching branches if the working directory or staging area
has uncommited changes that conflict with the branch that is being checked
out.

It is safe to checkout another branch, if for example:
- a) the working tree and staging area are clean
- b) a new file appears in the working directory or has been staged
- c) a modified file was in the same state in the last commit of both branches

In case (b) or (c), the additions/changes are just carried over to the other
branch.

*** merging
**** fast-forward merge
If the branch that merges is part of the history of the branch that is
being merged in, a *fast-forward* merge strategy just moves the pointer of
the merging branch forward to the last commit of the merged-in branch.

#+CAPTION: master is fast-forwarded to hotfix
#+NAME: fig_fast-forward
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[./_res/git/basic-branching-5.png]]

**** three-way merge
If the last commits of both branches are ahead of their common ancestor
(i.e. the branches are diverging), Git will try to fit the changes of
both branches together in a conflict-free way, which is not always
possible.
- Git merges changes even in the same file, if they are not contradictory
- in case of a conflict, automatic merge will fail

If the merge is successful, it will result in a merge commit, which has
the latest commits of both branches as its two parents.

#+CAPTION: A three-way merge commit
#+NAME: fig_three-way-merge
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[./_res/git/basic-merging-2.png]]

**** merge conflicts
In case of a merge conflict, [[git status]] shows which unmerged paths exist
and the conflicting files contain annotations with the diverging content
from each branch.

Example of a conflict in a merged file:
: <<<<<<< HEAD:index.html
: <div id="footer">contact : email.support@github.com</div>
: =======
: <div id="footer">
:  please contact us at support@github.com
: </div>
: >>>>>>> iss53:index.html

The issue can be resolved by replacing the entire block with the desired
alternative or a different resolution (perhaps a compromise).
- with [[git mergetool]] a merge tool can be used instead of manual edits

After resolving each conflicting section, the file can be staged and is
thereby marked as resolved in Git.

Committing the changes concludes the merge.


*** rebasing
Reapplies all changes/commits on one branch onto the last commit of
another branch, as if it has been part of its history all along.
- cleaner history than with a merge, but less truthful
  - dates of newer commits might be older than previous ones
  - rebased commits will have a new commit-SHA
- will create the same snapshot as with merge, only the history is different

*Do not rebase commits that exist outside your repository and that people
may have based work on.*

*Rebase local changes before pushing to clean up your work, but never
rebase anything that you’ve pushed somewhere.*

To rebase a branch onto another one:
: $ git switch <to-rebase-branch>
: $ git rebase <rebase-onto-branch>

Conflicts are handled the same way as with a three-way merge
- see [[merge conflicts]]

Then, finish the rebase with ~git rebase --continue~. The HEAD will now
point to the rebased branch and a [[fast-forward merge]] can be done to move
the pointer of the rebased-onto branch forward.
: $ git switch <rebase-onto-branch>
: $ git merge <to-rebase-branch>

#+CAPTION: Rebasing the change introduced in C4 onto C3
#+NAME: fig_rebase-after
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[./_res/git/basic-rebase-3.png]]

If someone force-pushed rebased commits (and thus changed those commits),
it is best to try either:
- ~git pull --rebase~ or
- ~git fetch~ followed by ~git rebase <remote-branch>~
which can often cleanly apply the rebase to local work based on its
history (see https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing).

*** tracking branch
A /tracking branch/ is a local branch that tracks a [[remote tracking branch]].

[[git clone]] automatically creates tracking branches that correspond to the
remote branches (e.g. ~master~ for ~origin/master~).

New tracking branches can be created with [[git checkout]]:
- ~$ git checkout -b <tracking-branch> <remote>/<branch>~
- ~$ git checkout --track <remote>/<branch>~ (shorthand)
- ~$ git checkout <branch>~ only if
  - ~<branch>~ doesn’t already exist and
  - its name matches the name of the remote tracking branch

To set up a branch to track another remote branch, use
: $ git branch -u <remote>/<branch>

~@{upstream}~ or ~@{u}~ can be used as a shorthand to refer to the upstream
branch of a tracking branch without naming it directly.
- e.g. use ~$ git merge @{u}~ instead of ~$ git merge origin/master~

Tracking branches can be looked up with ~$ git branch -vv~ .
- the information is only as up-to-date as the last ~$ git fetch~ command

*** remote tracking branch
A /remote tracking branch/ is a branch that is a reference to the state of a
corresponding branch on a remote repository.

It is a pointer that Git automatically generates (e.g. when calling ~git
clone~) and that moves along with the corresponding [[remote branch]] when
remote operations are called.
- [[git fetch]] fetches any new data on the remote branch and moves the remote
  tracking branch pointer to its new, up-to-date position

Remote-tracking branch names take the form ~<remote>/<branch>~ .

With ~$ git branch --all~, all tracking branches can be seen.

With ~$ git checkout <remote>/<branch>~ it is possible to checkout a remote
tracking branch and examine its current state.
- Git will be in [[Detached HEAD State]]
- this only works for ~git switch~ with ~--detach~ option

*** remote branch
A /remote branch/ is a branch in a remote repository.

To delete remote branches use:
: $ git push <remote> --delete <remote-branch>

*** creating a branch from a previous commit
To create a branch from a previous commit,
1. checkout the commit in /detached HEAD state/: ~$ git checkout <commit-SHA>~
2. make changes and commit them
3. create a new branch from new commit-SHA: ~$ git branch <name> <new-SHA>~

Or just create the branch immediately with [[git switch]]:
: $ git switch -c <branch-name> <commit-SHA>

** Detached HEAD State
https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/detached-head-when-checkout-commit/

State Git enters when checking out a commit instead of a branch.

In this state, Git does not automatically move the HEAD pointer along when a
new commit is created.
- new commits will not belong to any branch and therefore will be hard to
  recover after switching to a branch
- to create a branch for those changes, see [[creating a branch from a
  previous commit]]

[[git rebase]] creates a temporary detached HEAD state while it runs.

** Stash
** Tracking / Staging
*Tracked files* are files that Git knows about:
- files that were in the last [[Snapshot]]
- newly /staged/ files

There are 3 main sections in a Git project:
- [[Working Tree]]
- Staging Area
- .git directory

#+CAPTION: Working tree, staging area, and Git directory
#+NAME: fig_areas
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[./_res/git/areas.png]]

The state of a tracked file is either:
- /unmodified/
- /modified/
- /staged/

#+CAPTION: The lifecycle of the status of files in a repository
#+NAME: fig_lifecycle
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[./_res/git/lifecycle.png]]

Use [[git status]] to determine which files are in which state.
- any newly created file is automatically untracked
- after [[Cloning]] a repo, all files are automatically tracked and unmodified.

Use [[git add]] to track any new or modified files.
- the files are commited exactly as they are at the moment ~git add~ was called

Use [[git restore]] to undo changes to the working tree or staging area
- any file with unstaged local changes can be reverted to the state of its last
  stage/commit
- after a file has been added to the staging area (index) and removed in the
  working tree with ~$ rm …~, it can still be restored with this command
- to unstage an added file, use the ~--staged~ option

Use [[git rm]] to remove a file from the staging area (index) *and* working tree.
- if the file has been modified or already added to the staging area, removal
  must be forced with the ~-f~ option (prevents accidental deletion if the file
  hasn’t yet been recorded in a snapshot)
- if the file has been committed before or if it has been removed from the
  working tree by ~$ rm …~, it can be removed from the staging area as well with
  ~git rm~
- a file that is removed from staging will not be restorable with ~git restore~

Use [[git diff]] to see which changes exactly have been made since staging.

Git doesn’t track file movement, but figures out renames and movement after the
fact. Otherwise, use [[git mv]] to move/rename a staged/tracked file.

** Snapshot
Recorded state of the project after files have been added to the staging area
and committed.

** Checkout
** Working Tree
** Git Index
The *index* is a binary file (generally kept in =.git/index=) containing a
sorted list of path names, each with /permissions/ and the /SHA1/ of a blob
object.
- Git stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash
  value of its contents

~git ls-files~ can show you the contents of the index:
#+begin_src shell
$ git ls-files --stage
100644 63c918c667fa005ff12ad89437f2fdc80926e21c 0   .gitignore
100644 5529b198e8d14decbe4ad99db3f7fb632de0439d 0   .mailmap
#+end_src

#+CAPTION: Role of the index within the Git system
#+NAME: fig_git-index
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[./_res/git/NueSy.png]]

The Git index is a critical data structure in Git. It serves as the /“staging
area”/ between the files you have on your filesystem and your /commit history/.
- When you run ~git add~, the files from your working directory are /hashed/ and
  stored as objects in the /index/, leading them to be “staged changes”.
- When you run ~git commit~, the staged changes as stored in the /index/ are
  used to create that new commit.
- When you run ~git checkout~, Git takes the data from a commit and writes it
  to the /working directory/ and the /index/.

It represents a /virtual working tree/ state by recording list of paths and
their object names and serves as a /staging area/ to write out the next tree
object to be committed. The state is "virtual" in the sense that it does not
necessarily have to, and often does not, match the files in the working
tree.

In addition to storing your staged changes, the index also stores filesystem
information about your working directory. This helps Git report changed
files more quickly.

* Recipes
** Truncate commit history

1. Copy SHA and commit date from the log of the commit that should be the
   new root.
2. Create a new orphan branch from that root’s SHA:
   : $ git checkout --orphan temp <new-root-SHA>
3. Commit to that branch reusing commit
   msg and date with the ~-C~ flag:
   : $ git commit -C <new-root-SHA>
   - to retain original commit date:
     : $ export GIT_COMMITTER_DATE='<old-commit-date>'
     : ... commit ...
     : $ unset GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
4. Rebase commits from new root to HEAD of its branch on top of ~temp~:
   : $ git rebase --onto temp <new-root-SHA> <new-root-branch>
   - add flag ~--committer-date-is-author-date~ to retain original commit dates
5. Delete ~temp~ branch and maybe the old branches:
   : $ git branch -d temp
   : $ git branch -D <old-branch>
6. Completely remove the old loose objects (CANNOT BE UNDONE):
   : $ git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   : $ git gc --prune=now

* Data recovery
Anything /that is committed/ in Git can almost always be recovered.

Even commits that were on branches that were deleted or commits that were
overwritten with an ~--amend~ commit can be recovered.
- see https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/_data_recovery

However, anything you lose that was never committed is likely never to be seen
again.


* API

** Create
*** git init
Initializes a repository.
:  --bare  < creates a bare repository

*** git clone
: $ git clone https://github.com/...  > clone repository
: $ git clone <url> <dirname>         > can choose a different dir name
:  -o <name>  > choose a different remote name (default: “origin”)

** Check
*** git config
: $ git config
: --global / --system / --local     > specify config file
: --list / -l                       > list settings
: --show-origin                     > show origin of settings

Example settings:
: $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
: $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
: $ git config --global core.editor nvim         > change default Editor
: $ git config --global init.defaultBranch main  > change default branch name

: $ git config <config-key>             > look up specific config value
: $ git config --get remote.origin.url  > check remote url

There are 3 places for git configuration:
1. *system*: =[path]/etc/gitconfig=
   - [path]: installation path, e.g. =/opt/homebrew=
2. *global*: =~/.gitconfig= or =~/.config/git/config=
3.  *local*: =.git/config= (in project repo)

Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in =.git/config= trump those in =[path]/etc/gitconfig=.

*** git status
Shows changes from last commit.
: -s, --short  < shortened status report

The short report has the form: ~LR <filename>~
- symbol in ~L~ shows status of the staging area
- symbol in ~R~ shows status of the working tree

Short symbols:
| ~A~  | newly added files          |
| ~M~  | modified files             |
| ~U~  | unmerged files             |
| ~D~  | removed (via ~git rm~) files |
| ~R~  | renamed files              |
| ~??~ | untracked files            |

*** git log
Shows commit log from current branch (where ~HEAD~ points to), optionally of a
different branch or all branches.

: $ git log <?branch>
: --all            > show all branches
: -p, -u, --patch  > show patch/diff for each commit
: --stat           > show file change statistics
: --shortstat      > like `--stat`, but only changed/inserts/deletes line
: --graph          > adds ASCII graph showing branch and merge history
: --oneline        > alias to `--pretty=oneline`
: --decorate       > not needed in newer Git versions because default

Use ~--format=fuller~ to also show commit date.
- GitHub will only show commit date!

**** Filtering options
: -<n>                       > limit to `n` log entries
: --since=<x>, --after=<x>   > limit to commits made after date <x>
: --until=<x>, --before=<x>  > limit to commits made before date <x>
: --author=<x>               > only show commits from author <x>
: --committer=<x>            > only show commits from committer <x>
: --grep="str"               > only show if commit message contains str
: -S "str"                   > only show if added/removed code contains str
: -- path/to/file            > limit to commits that added or changed the
:                              specified file or directory
: --no-merges                > don’t show merge commits

*Note:* ~-- path~ must be the last option! (dashes can be omitted)

*Note:* You can specify more than one instance of both the ~--author~ and ~--grep~
search criteria, which will limit the commit output to commits that match any of
the ~--author~ patterns and any of the ~--grep~ patterns; however, adding the
~--all-match~ option further limits the output to just those commits that match
all ~--grep~ patterns. [[[https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History][Source]]]

***** Example:
To see which commits modifying test files in the Git source code history were
committed by Junio Hamano in the month of October 2008 and are not merge
commits:
: $ git log --pretty="%h - %s" --author='Junio C Hamano'
:   --since="2008-10-01" --before="2008-11-01" --no-merges -- t/

**** Formatting options
: --pretty=<opt>   > shows commits in an alternate format
: --oneline        > shorthand for `--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit`
: --name-only      > show list of files modified after commit information
: --name-status    > show list of files affected with
:                    added/modified/deleted information as well
: --abbrev-commit  > show only the first few characters of SHA-1 checksum
: --relative-date  > display date in a relative format (e.g. “2 weeks ago”)

***** ~--pretty~ options:

| Option     | Description of Output                              |
|------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| ~oneline~    | prints each commit on one line with commit message |
| ~short~      | less information on commit meta                    |
| ~full~       | more information on commit meta                    |
| ~fuller~     | most information on commit meta                    |
| ~format:"…"~ | use own formatting                                 |

**** Recipes

Show direct parent of a commit:
: $ git log --pretty=%P -n 1 <commit-id>
- see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44112593/how-to-get-the-parent-of-a-specific-commit-in-git for other options
*** git rev-list
Show first commit from ~HEAD~:
: $ git rev-list --max-parents=0 --abbrev-commit HEAD

*** git diff
: $ git diff
Compares any unstaged changes in the working dir to the staging area.

: $ git diff --staged  (or --cached which is a synonym)
Compares any staged changes to the last commit.

*** git difftool
Like [[git diff]] but with an external diff tool.

Use a specific diff tool:
: $ git difftool -t nvimdiff

See which tools are available on the system:
: $ git difftool --tool-help

** Prepare
*** git add
Add new or modified files to the staging area to be commited.
: $ git add <file/dir>  > adds file or all files in directory to stage
: $ git add -A          > adds all new/modified files to stage
*** git rm
Removes files from the working tree and from the index.
: $ git rm <filename>
: -f, --force  < forces removal

To just remove a file from the staging area:
: $ git rm --cached <filename>
- useful if a file has been accidentally added that should not be tracked

Can be passed files, directories, and file-glob patterns:
: $ git rm log/\*.log  < removes all files with `.log` extension in `log/`
: $ git rm \*~         < removes all files whose names end with `~`
- ~\~ is necessary because Git does its own filename expansion

*** git mv
Moves and/or renames a tracked file in working dir and stage area.
Git figures out renames implicitly, so this command is redundant.

: git mv <old-file> <new-file>

This is equivalent to something like this:
: $ mv <old-file> <new-file>
: $ git rm <old-file>
: $ git add <new-file>

*** git restore
Discards changes in working directory (for specified files).
: $ git restore <file/dir>
:   --staged  < to unstage staged files

- *WARNING*: unstaged changes may be lost forever!
- ~git restore <file>~ may be equivalent to ~git checkout -- <file>~ ?
- ~git restore --staged <file>~ may be equivalent to ~git reset HEAD <file>~ ?

*** git stash
https://git-scm.com/book/de/v1/Git-Tools-Stashen

: $ git stash save             > save changes in stash (no commit)
: $ git stash list             > list all stashes
: $ git stash apply            > apply last stash
: $ git stash apply stash@{x}  > apply stash

** Commit
*** git commit
: $ git commit       > commit with message (in editor)
:   -m "My message"  > set commit message directly
:   -v, --verbose    > puts diff of changes in commit editor
:   -a, --all        > auto-stage modified/deleted files, but NOT new ones
:   --amend          > changes last commit
:   --no-edit        > no change to commit message with --amend
:   --allow-empty    > allow commit with the same tree as its parent commit

Commit output on command line: ~[<branch> <SHA-1 checksum>]~

Stages modified or deleted files, but NOT new ones:
: $ git commit -a

To correct an accidental commit, make changes to the staging area (or not, to
just change the commit message) and commit again with ~git commit --amend~.
- the old commit message can then be changed, or left alone with ~--no-edit~
- the state of each file will be as if the previous commit never happened
- the old commit will technically not be changed, but replaced (new hash)

Infos on ~amend~:

*** git tag
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging

: $ git tag                             > show available tags
: $ git show <tag_name>                 > show commit of specific tag
: $ git tag <tag_name>                  > create lightweight tag
: $ git tag -d <tag_name>               > delete local tag <tag_name>
: $ git tag <tag_name> -a -m "Message"  > create annotated tag

Rename a tag:
- see https://stackoverflow.com/a/5719854/1204047
: $ git tag <new> <old>
: $ git tag -d <old>

** Branch
*** git branch
Show branches (active branch with *):
: $ git branch
:  -a, --all    > list both remote-tracking and local branches
:  -v           > show information on last commit for each branch
:  -vv          > also show tracking information on each branch
:  --merged     > filter branches merged into the current branch
:  --no-merged  > filter branches not yet merged into the current branch
: $ git branch | grep \* | cut -d ' ' -f2   > shows only active branch
- ~--merged~ and ~--no-merged~ can be given a branch-name as an argument to
  see what is merged into that branch instead of the branch currently
  active

Create new branch:
: $ git branch <branch-name>

Change name of branch:
: $ git branch -m <new-name>             > change name of current branch
: $ git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>  > change name of branch from a different branch

Delete branch:
: $ git branch -d <branch-to-delete>  > deletes only when merged
: $ git branch -D <branch-to-delete>  > ignores merge

*** git checkout
Moves ~HEAD~ pointer to specified branch and reverts the files in working
directory back to the snapshot that this branch is pointing to.
: $ git checkout <branch/commit-hash>
: -f, --force  > discards local changes
: --orphan     > creates orphan branch (no parent, history disconnected)
- can also be given a /SHA1 hash/ of a specific commit instead of branch name
  -> needs only first 7 chars of the SHA
  -> this puts Git in /“detached HEAD” mode/.

Create new branch and switch to it:
: $ git checkout -b <new-branch>

Save stash and change branch:
: $ git stash save && git checkout <branch>

Update data in <path> only on main branch:
- see:  http://nicolasgallagher.com/git-checkout-specific-files-from-another-branch/
: $ git checkout main -- <path>

Set older commit as new HEAD:
: $ git rm -r .            > remove any files of current commit
: $ git checkout HEAD~n .  > checkout revision n commits ago
:                            (doesn't change where HEAD points to)
: $ git commit             > make revision newest commit

*** git switch
Switch to an existing branch:
: $ git switch <branch/commit-hash>
: --detach  > switch with detached HEAD (to checkout a specific commit)

Create a new branch and switch to it:
: $ git switch -c <new-branch>  > or with --create
Also works from a specific commit:
: $ git switch -c <new-branch> <commit-hash>

Return to previously checked out branch:
: $ git switch -

*** git merge
Merges <new-branch> with current (checkout) branch, but doesn't delete it!
: $ git merge <new-branch>

https://www.atlassian.com/de/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge
*** git mergetool
*** git rebase
: --root  < rebase all reachable commits up to the root(s)

Explanation: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29916361/1204047

3 rebase granularities:
- Branch rebase /“quick”/
- Parent rebase /“precise”/
- General rebase /“surgical”/

**** Branch rebase:
: $ git rebase <onto-branch>
- most common and simplest case of rebasing

Rebases the current ~HEAD~ branch on top of the /latest commit/ that is
reachable from ~<onto-branch>~, but not from ~HEAD~:
:         Before                           After
:   A---B---C---F---G (branch)        A---B---C---F---G (branch)
:            \                                         \
:             D---E (HEAD)                              D---E (HEAD)

**** Parent rebase:
: $ git rebase --onto <new-parent> <old-parent>
- “onto” means “on top of”
- rebases the commit reachable from ~HEAD~ whose parent is ~<old-parent>~ /on
  top of/ ~<new-parent>~

Changes the parent of a particular commit from ~<old-parent>~ to ~<new-parent>~:

:         Before                           After
:   A---B---C---F---G (branch)        A---B---C---F---G (branch)
:            \                                     \
:             D---E---H---I (HEAD)                  E---H---I (HEAD)
with ~$ git rebase --onto F D~

Can also be used to remove some commits in between two commits:
:         Before                       After
:   A---B---C---E---F (HEAD)        A---B---F (HEAD)
with ~$ git rebase --onto B E~

**** General rebase:
: $ git rebase --onto <new-parent> <old-parent> <until>
- how does this work exactly?

Rebase the range of commits whose parent is D up to H on top of F:
:         Before                                     After
:   A---B---C---F---G (branch)                A---B---C---F---G (branch)
:            \                                             \
:             D---E---H---I (HEAD)                          E---H (HEAD)
with ~$ git rebase --onto F D H~

*** git clean
: $ git clean
: -n, --dry-run  > don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be
: -f, --force    > force deletion
: -d             > also recurse into untracked directories
: -x             > also delete files caught by .gitignore
: -X             > remove only files ignored by Git

Deletes untracked files/folders in working directory.

Test before delete:
1. make a test-run to see what would be deleted:
   : $ git clean -nfd
2. remove ~-n~ flag to actually delete

*Avoid the -x option since it can remove local configs!*

: $ git clean -fxd :/
Cleans untracked and ignored files through the entire repo (without ~:/~,
the operation affects only the current directory)

*** git reset
: $ git reset HEAD   > revert HEAD (e.g. after 'git rm')
:                      (keeps uncommited changes)
: --hard   > DELETES uncommited changes
: --soft   > keeps changes and working tree (?)
: --merge  > solves merge-problems (?)

~git reset --hard~ removes staged changes as well as working directory changes.

git-reset does up to three things:
1. it *points* the ~HEAD~ ref at a new /'target'/ commit, if specified
2. then it *copies* the tree of the ~HEAD~ commit to the /index/, unless ~--soft~
3. finally, it *copies* the contents of the /index/ to the /working tree/, if
   ~--hard~

** Remote
*** git remote
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17122245/what-is-a-git-upstream

Show associated remote repos:
: $ git remote
: -v, --verbose  > shows additional information

Show detailled infos about a specific remote repo:
: $ git remote show <remote>

Show SHA of last commit on remote branches:
: $ git ls-remote <remote>

Add remote repo:
: $ git remote add <remote-name> <url/dir>
- ~origin~ is a common convention of a name for a remote connection
- local repositories can also be added by specifying the repo path

Change remote name:
: $ git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>
- changes all remote-tracking branch names as well

Change remote url:
: $ git remote set-url <remote-name> <remote-url>

Remove remote repo:
: $ git remote remove <remote>
- removes all remote-tracking branches and configuration settings
  associated with that remote

*** git push
: $ git push <remote> <branch>
: $ git push <remote> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
: -f, --force         > overwrite existing remote branch
: -u, --set-upstream  > push and create upstream branch on remote repo
: -d, --delete        > delete refs
push to <remote> on <branch>

*Note:* Git doesn’t allow to push to a non-bare repository.
- set ~git config receive.denyCurrentBranch ignore~ on the remote repo to
  still allow pushing
- then, to remove inconsistencies of index and working tree, use ~git reset
  –hard~ after every push

: $ git push -u <remote> <branch>
: $ git push <remote> -d <branch>

tags:
: $ git push <remote> --tags                  > push all tags to remote
: $ git push <remote> <tag-name>              > push specific tag to remote

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely
: $ git push <remote> -d <remote-branch> > delete remote branch
: $ git push <remote> :<remote-branch>   > delete remote branch

*** git fetch
: $ git fetch <remote>
: --all  < fetches from all remotes
Fetches all commits and branches not on local.
- only downloads new data from remote, never integrates them into working files
- updates [[remote tracking branch]] to match the remote branch it tracks

: $ git fetch origin <remote> :<remote-branch>
pull only branch <remote> :<remote-branch>

*** git pull
Fetch data in remote branch and merge.
- <=> git fetch <remote> && git merge origin/<curr_branch>
: $ git pull <remote>
: --no-commit  > without merge-commit
: --rebase     > using git rebase to merge
: --verbose    > show detailed info about fetched data and merge

Pull and merge ~<remote-branch>~ into the current branch:
: $ git pull <remote> <remote-branch>
** Worktree
*** git worktree
: git worktree add <path> <branch>

* GitHub
** SSH Authentication

Github SSH login:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh

Add new remote-branch for local repo:
- https://gist.github.com/zhujunsan/a0becf82ade50ed06115

: $ cd .ssh

: $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "github-formsandlines"

filename: ~id_rsa.<my-repo-name>~

no passphrase


Add new key in GitHub repo settings -> ~Deploy keys~

Name: ~id_rsa.<my-repo-name>~

Print and copy key in terminal:
: $ cat id_rsa.<my-repo-name>.pub

insert in GitHub, with write/push-permissions.


Authentication on GitHub via SSH:
- see: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent
- also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16245606/could-not-read-from-remote-repository

start/wake ssh-agent in the background:

: $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

: $ nano ~/.ssh/config

content:
: Host *
:   AddKeysToAgent yes
:   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.<my-repo-name>

: $ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa.<my-repo-name>

check, if key is added in agent:
: $ ssh-add -l
** GitHub pages

*** Creating a separate branch for GitHub pages

- [[https://github.com/babashka/fs/tree/f4c7394c91a273ca97fbd9014bc355703992025b#codox][Instructions (old)]]
- [[https://github.com/weavejester/codox/wiki/Deploying-to-GitHub-Pages][Instructions on Codox Wiki]]
- [[https://github.com/formsandlines/codox-test][My test repo (private)]]

To add Codox documentation to a Clojure project:
1. Copy script =codox.sh= and make it executable
2. Add Codox task to =deps.edn=
3. Follow instructions below to create an isolated branch
4. Push Codox docs to ~gh-pages~ using the script

Create an orphan branch named ~gh-pages~:
: $ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
Remove all files from staging:
: $ git rm -rf .
Create an empty commit so that you will be able to push on the branch:
: $ git commit --allow-empty -m 'Init empty branch'
Push branch ~gh-pages~:
: $ git push origin gh-pages

Switch back to ~main~ branch:
: $ git switch main
Create =gh-pages= directory:
: $ mkdir gh-pages
Add ~gh-pages/~ to =.gitignore=:
: $ echo "gh-pages/" >> .gitignore
Create a new worktree:
: $ git worktree add gh-pages gh-pages

* General information

R is a dialect of the language *S* from 1976 by John Chambers and others at Bell
Labs.
- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R-and-S][R and S]]

Features of R:
- dynamically typed
- designed for interactive use, not production
- lazy evaluation
- slow (~ 100x slower than C)
  - maybe interface with C++ to rewrite parts for performance
- first-class functions, closures
- objects
  - /s3/ -> older system, more permissive/convenient, more popular
  - /s4/ -> newer system, more rigorous, better interfacing with other langs
- vector-oriented (everything is a vector)
- pass by value
- everything is nullable
  - ~NA~ -> not available (the value is there, but we don’t know it)
  - ~NULL~ -> does not exist
- for-loops are inefficient in R

** Editors

- [[https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/][RStudio]] -> IDE
- [[https://ess.r-project.org][ess]] -> Emacs plugin

* REPL

Start R REPL:
: $ R
Or use the desktop application.

REPL-specific commands:
: demo()  -- some demos
: q()     -- exit REPL

Getting help:
: help()         -- open R help systems
: help.start()   -- open as HTML in browser
: help(<topic>)  -- get help for a specific command
:   ?<topic>
: help.search(<topic>)  -- fuzzy/RegEx search
:   ??<topic>
: example(<topic>)  -- get examples for a help topic
- some subjects (e.g. containing special characters) must be enclosed in
  double quotes
- try ~?help.search~ for details and more examples


* RStudio

IDE for R.
- https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Resources:
- [[https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/][RStudio IDE User Guide]]

Keyboard shortcuts: ~opt + shift + k~ to open reference

* Environment

The *working directory* is set to the directory ~R~ was launched in, which is most
often the /home/ directory.

Working directory:
: getwd()
: setwd(<dir>)

Use ~paste~ to create a path with ~getwd()~:
: data <- read.csv(paste(getwd(),"myfile.csv",sep=""))

** Workspace

The *workspace* is the collection of [[*Objects][objects]] stored in an R session.
- objects are created and stored by name

List names of (most of) the objects stored in the R session:
: objects() : ls()

It can be stored permanently in a file (called ~.RData~) for future R sessions.
- on ~q()~, R asks to save the workspace
- it will be saved in the current working directory (-> ~$ pwd~)
- R will also save a file ~.Rhistory~ which contains the command lines used in
  the session

To restore a workspace, change into directory where it was stored and launch ~R~.

To remove objects from a workspace:
: rm(<obj>, …)

Save workspace:
: save.image(?file = <path>, …)
Read saved workspaces:
: load(…)

* Packages

Install a package (from /CRAN/):
: install.packages("packagename")
- or via RStudio interface
- use ~c("foo", "bar", …)~ to install multiple packages

Load a package:
: library(packagename)

** tidyverse

Opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages
share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.
- [[https://www.tidyverse.org]]
- [[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][Issues with tidyverse]] & [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20362626][debate]]

: install.packages("tidyverse")

*Core packages* of ~tidyverse~ are:
- [[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org][ggplot2]]: system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar
  of Graphics
- [[https://dplyr.tidyverse.org][dplyr]]: provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set
  of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges
- [[https://tidyr.tidyverse.org][tidyr]]: provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data
- [[https://readr.tidyverse.org][readr]]: provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like
  csv, tsv, and fwf)
- [[https://purrr.tidyverse.org][purrr]]: enhances R’s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a
  complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and
  vectors
- [[https://tibble.tidyverse.org][tibble]]: a modern re-imagining of the data frame, keeping what time has
  proven to be effective, and throwing out what it has not
- [[https://stringr.tidyverse.org][stringr]]: provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working
  with strings as easy as possible
- [[https://forcats.tidyverse.org][forcats]]: provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with
  factors

** other useful packages

: arrow, babynames, curl, duckdb, gapminder, ggrepel, ggridges, ggthemes, hexbin, janitor, Lahman, leaflet, maps, nycflights13, openxlsx, palmerpenguins, repurrrsive, tidymodels, writexl

* Comments

: # comment

* Variables

Assignment in the current/local environment:
: <name> <- <value>
: <value> -> <name>
: <name> = <value>
: assign(<name>, <value>)
- if declared inside a function, the variable is local to that function
- brackets do not set a new scope (e.g. in variables declared in if-statements
  are accessible from outside)

Assignment in the global environment:
: <name> <<- <value>
- can be declared inside a function and used outside of it

See [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10904124/global-and-local-variables-in-r][Global and local variables in R (Stack Overflow)]]


* Data structures

** Objects

*Objects* are the entities that R creates and manipulates.
- may be variables, arrays of numbers, character strings, functions, or more
  general structures built from such components

*6 atomic classes* of objects:
- character
- numeric (real numbers)
- integer
- complex
- logical (boolean)
- raw (?)

~NULL~ is also considered /atomic/.

[[*Vectors][Vectors]] are the *most basic object*, but not all atomic types are vectors

All objects can have an attribute ~names~.
- when providing values for objects, names can be given with ~myname = <val>~

Get the /type/ of object ~x~:
: typeof(<x>)

Get the /class/ of object ~x~:
: class(<x>)
- not always the same as /type/, e.g. a number has class ~numeric~ but type
  ~double~

Get the ~names~ attribute of ~x~:
: names(<x>)

Check if object ~x~ is /atomic/ or /recursive/:
: is.atomic(<x>)
: is.recursive(<x>)

Return the number of rows/columns in ~x~, a /vector/, /array/ or /data frame/:
: nrow(<x>)
: ncol(<x>)

Return the first or last parts of a /vector/, /matrix/, /table/, /data frame/ or
/function/:
: head(<obj>)
: tail(<obj>)
- mostly used to see what the data looks like

Get the number of items of ~obj~:
: length(<obj>)

Reverse ~obj~:
: rev(<obj>)

Get the ~TRUE~ indices of a logical object, allowing for array indices:
: which(<logvec/arr>, …)

*** Modes
*** Attributes

R objects can have attributes:
- ~names~, ~dimnames~
- ~dimensions~ (e.g. matrices, arrays)
- ~class~
- ~length~
- other user-defined attributes/metadata

Get attribute list of ~x~ (not all attr.):
: attributes(<x>)
- returns ~NULL~ if no attributes found

** Primitives

By default, *numbers* are created as /double precision real numbers/.

To explicitly create an *integer number*, append suffix ~L~.

To create a *complex number*, write e.g. ~2+4i~.

Special Symbols:

| Value | Explanation   | Type    |
|-------+---------------+---------|
| ~Inf~   | infinity      | ~numeric~ |
| ~TRUE~  | logical true  | ~logical~ |
| ~FALSE~ | logical false | ~logical~ |
| ~NA~    | Not Available | ~logical~ |
| ~NaN~   | Not a Number  | ~numeric~ |

- ~NA~ values can have a /class/ like /numeric/, /logical/, etc.
- ~NaN~ are considered also ~NA~ but the converse is not true
- ~T~ and ~F~ are abbreviations for true/false, but just variables, which can be
  overwritten by the user
- ~logical~ values can also be used by numeric operators, which will coerce
  them into ~0~ and ~1~
- ~1 / 0~ = ~Inf~, ~0 / 0~ = ~NaN~, ~1 / Inf~ = ~0~

Test if an object is ~NA~ / ~NaN~:
: is.na(<obj>)
- returns a logical vector of same size as ~obj~

To only check for ~NaN~:
: is.nan(<obj>)

** Atomic objects
*** Vectors

Properties:
- elements must have the same type/class
- can be expanded indefinitely

*Atomic vector modes* are:
- ~logical~: booleans
- ~numeric~: numbers (created as ~double~)
- ~character~: strings
- ~integer~ (also considered ~numeric~ ?)
- ~complex~
- ~raw~

*Other vector modes*:
- ~list~
- ~expression~
- ~any~

*Primitives are vectors* of length 1.
- e.g. numbers, strings, booleans
- arithmetic operators work on vectors mixed with vector or scalar arguments
- functions that take numeric args can also take vector args

Create a “simple” vector (no attributes):
: vector(mode = "<mode>", length = <length>)
- use ~vector()~ for empty vectors (type is ~logical~)
- initializes the vector with /default/ values (e.g. ~0~ for numeric v.)

Create a new vector from ~x~, but with mode ~mode~ instead:
: as.vector(<x>, mode = "<mode>")

Check if object ~x~ is a vector of specified ~mode~:
: is.vector(<x>, mode = "<mode>")
- should have no attributes other than ~names~

Create/concatenate a vector from elements:
: c(<el1>, <el2>, …)
- coerces numbers to strings, if strings are elements
- coerces booleans to numbers (~0~ or ~1~), if numbers are elements
- merges vector elements to a single flat vector

Append to a vector:
: append(<vec>, <el>)
- same as ~c(<vec>, <el>)~

Construct a range of numbers (vector mode is ~integer~):
: <from>:<to>
- can be int, float and negative numbers

Map names/keys to vector values:
: names(<vec>) <- c(<name1>, <name2>, …)
- must have same length as ~vec~ (or less?)
- enables key-based referencing: ~myvec["mykey"]~

Coerce vectors into different types:
: as.numeric(<vec>)
: as.logical(<vec>)
: as.character(<vec>)
: as.complex(<vec>)
- elements that are not coerceable are returned as ~NA~
- complex numbers from real numbers get a 0 imaginary part

Sort (or order) a vector or factor (partially) into /ascending/ or
/descending/ order:
: sort(<vec/fac>, ?decreasing=<bool>, …)

**** Index Vector

An /index vector/ ~[…]~ can select subsets of a vector.
- not only for variable names but for any expression that evaluates as a
  vector
- indices effectively start at ~1~; index ~0~ is the vector type

Types:
- *numerical vector*
  - e.g. ~x[2]~, ~x[c(3,5,7)]~, ~x[3:6]~
- *logical vector*
  - e.g. ~x[!is.na(x)]~, ~x[x < 5]~, ~x[c(T,F,T)]~, ~x[x$a > 3 & x$b < 5]~
  - ~TRUE~ values are selected, ~FALSE~ values omitted
- *character string vector*
  - e.g. ~x[c("apple", "orange")]~
  - only applies if ~x~ has a ~names~ attribute to identify its components
- *sorted* (?)
  - e.g. ~x[order(x$foo),]~ sorts all rows of ~x~ by values of column ~foo~ if
    it is a data frame
    - ~x[rev(order(x$foo)),]~ to sort in /descending/ order

*** Factors

Provide compact ways to handle /categorical data/. A factor can be thought
of as an *integer vector* where each integer has a /label/ (/self-describing/).
- can be *unordered* or *ordered* (e.g. ranked categories)
- labels can be accessed just like in a vector
- treated specially by /modelling functions/ like ~lm()~ and ~glm()~

The *levels* of a factor describe the categories, they can be /ordered/ in
different ways or remain /unordered/ (?).

Calling ~unclass(<fac>)~ will return an integer vector with the integers
corresponding to the order of categories in ~levels~.

Create a factor from a vector:
: factor(?x=<charvec>, ?levels=<charvec>, ?ordered=<bool>)
- an optional ~levels~ vector can be provided to explicitly specify the
  order of levels
- other vector types are coerced to a character vector
- default for ~ordered~ is ~is.ordered(<vec>)~

Get a vector of the levels from a factor:
: levels(<fac>)

Build a table of the frequency count for each factor level:
: table(<fac>, …)

Examples:
#+begin_src R
fac <- factor(c("low","high","mid","mid","high","low","mid"))
# fac:
# [1] low  high mid  mid  high low  mid
# Levels: high low mid
table(fac)
# :
# fac
# high  low  mid
#    2    2    3
#+end_src

*** Arrays / Matrices

/Multi-dimensional generalizations/ of vectors. Vector that has a
*dimensional vector* for its ~dim~ attribute.
- dimensional vectors are vectors of length /k/ (for a /k/-dimensional vector)
  that contain only /non-negative integers/
  - arrays can be one-dimensional (might cause confusion)
- values can be accessed by 2 or more indices (e.g. ~x[3,4,2]~)
  - (?) indices are in /column major order/, with the first subscript moving
    fastest and the last subscript slowest
  - lower dimensional *slices* can be made by omitting indices in the index
    vector, while keeping the comma-separation (e.g. ~x[4,,2,]~)

To create an array from a vector:
: dim(<vec>) <- <dimvec>

: array(?data=<vec>, ?dim=<dimvec>, ?dimnames=<list>)
- ~dim~ default: ~length(vec)~
- if ~data~ is not provided, fills entries with ~NA~
- ~array()~ => ~[1] NA~

In matrices, *names for dimensions* can be provided by the ~dimnames~
attribute, which takes a list of two vectors (/row names/ and /column names/).
- e.g. ~dimnames(m) <- list(c("a, "b"), c("c", "d"))~ for rows ~a~ and ~b~ and
  columns ~c~ and ~d~

: matrix(?data=<vec>, nrow=<int>, ncol=<int>, ?byrow=<bool>, ?dimnames=<list>)
- ~byrow~ -> if ~FALSE~ (default), matrix is filled by columns, otherwise rows
- if ~data~ is not provided, fills entries with ~NA~
- ~matrix()~ => ~[,1] [1,] NA~

Construct a matrix column-wise/row-wise:
: cbind(<col1>, <col2>, …)
: rbind(<row1>, <row2>, …)
- rows/cols can also be named with ~name=<val>~ syntax

Examples:
#+begin_src R
x <- 1:12
dim(x) <- c(3,4)  # creates a 3×4 array/matrix from x
# x:
#      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
# [1,]    1    4    7   10
# [2,]    2    5    8   11
# [3,]    3    6    9   12

x <- 1:1500
dim(x) <- c(3,5,100)  # 3×5×100 array

array(1:20, dim=c(4,5))
# :
#      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
# [1,]    1    5    9   13   17
# [2,]    2    6   10   14   18
# [3,]    3    7   11   15   19
# [4,]    4    8   12   16   20

cbind(1:3, 11:13, 21:23)
# :
#      [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]    1   11   21
# [2,]    2   12   22
# [3,]    3   13   23

rbind(1:3, 11:13, 21:23)
# :
#      [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]    1    2    3
# [2,]   11   12   13
# [3,]   21   22   23
#+end_src

** Recursive objects
*** Lists

General form of vector where elements types can be different.
- convenient way to return the results of a statistical computation
- lists are *recursive types* and can also contain other lists
- the elements of lists are always *singleton vectors*, hence the double
  brackets
- components can be *accessed by index* using double brackets, e.g. ~Lst[[2]]~
- list components *may also be named* and accessed like ~Lst$item.name~ or
  ~Lst[["item.name"]]~ (works also with variables for names)

Create a list:
: list(<item1>, <item2>, …)
- list components can be specified with a name like ~my.name=<value>~
- the components used to form the list are /copied/ for the new list

*** Data Frames

/Matrix-like/ structure, in which the /columns can be of different types/.
- used to store *tabular data*
- often returned by ~read.table()~ or ~read.csv()~ functions
- many experiments are best described by data frames: the treatments are
  categorical but the response is numeric

A /data frame/ is a *list* with class ~data.frame~, where every element /must
have the same length/.
- the components must be /vectors/ (numeric, character or logical), /factors/,
  /numeric matrices/, /lists/ or other /data frames/
- /vectors/ in the data frame must all have the /same length/ while /matrices/
  must all have the /same number of rows/
- matrices, lists and data frames provide /as many variables/ to the new
  data frame as they have columns, elements or variables, respectively

Get *column/row names*:
: names(<dframe>)
: row.names(<dframe>)

Select a specific *column* with ~<dframe>$colname~ or by index:
- ~<dframe>[2]~ or ~<dframe>["foo"]~ returns a *data frame* of one column
  (/column 2 or "foo"/ of the original data frame)
- ~<dframe>[,2]~, ~<dframe>[[2]]~, ~<drame>$foo~ and ~<dframe>[["foo"]]~ all
  return a *vector* of the entries of /column 2 or "foo"/

Select a specific *row* by index:
- ~<dframe>[2,]~ returns a *vector* of the entries of /row 2/

Select a *subset* of the data frame as another data frame:
- see [[*Index Vector][Index Vector]]

*Sort* a data frame by a specific column:
- see [[*Index Vector][Index Vector]]


Count number of rows/columns:
: nrow(<dframe>)
: ncol(<dframe>)

Create a data frame:
: data.frame(<col1>, <col2>, …, ?row.names=<int/str | int-/charvec>, …)
- columns can be named (just like with lists)
- ~row.names~ can be a single /integer or character string/ specifying a
  column to be used as row names, or a /character or integer vector/
- all columns must have the same number of elements/lines

Coerce a list to a data frame (if it conforms to the restrictions):
: as.data.frame(<list>)

Convert to a matrix:
: data.matrix()
- values of different types are coerced to match a single type

Examples:
#+begin_src R
data.frame(id=c("a","b","c"), name=c("George","Mary","Bob"), age=c(42,28,19),
           signed=c(T,F,T))
# :
#   id   name age signed
# 1  a George  42   TRUE
# 2  b   Mary  28  FALSE
# 3  c    Bob  19   TRUE
#+end_src

*** Expressions

*** Functions

Functions are objects themselves in R.

** Environments

Evaluate an R expression in an /environment/ constructed from (possibly a
modified copy of) ~data~:
: with(<data>, <expr>, …)
- e.g. ~with(df, foo)~ allows to just refer to column ~foo~ from data frame ~df~
  without having to write ~df$foo~
* Control structures

If expression:
: if(<cond>) <expr>
: if(<cond>) <cons.expr> else <alt.expr>
- returns the evaluated clause value or ~NULL~ (invisibly) if there is no ~else~
- use curly brackets for multi-line expressions

Iterative loop constructs for side-effects:
: for(<var> in <seq>) <expr>
: while(<cond>) <expr>
: repeat <expr>
- return ~NULL~ (invisibly)
- ~repeat~ repeats ~expr~ forever (or until ~break~ is called)

Break out of a ~for~, ~while~ or ~repeat~ loop:
: break

Halt processing of the current iteration and advance the /looping index/:
: next

* Basic math functions

Round number:
: floor(<x>) : ceiling(<n>)
: trunc(<x>, …)
: round(<x>, digits=<int>)
: signif(<x>, digits=<int>)

Sum over one or more vectors:
: sum(<vec> …, ?na.rm=<bool>)
- ~na.rm~ => should missing values (incl. ~NaN~) be removed?

* Statistical functions

Calculate the (trimmed) arithmetic mean:
: mean(<numvec>)
Calculate the median:
: median(<numvec>)

Apply a function ~f~ (e.g. ~mean~) to each group of the components from ~vec~,
defined by the levels of ~fac~:
: tapply(<vec>, <fac>, <f>)
- returns a structure of the same length as the levels attr. of ~fac~
- contrary to ~aggregate~, will fill in missing combinations with ~NA~

Split ~x~ into subsets, compute summary statistics for each, and return the
result in a convenient form:
: aggregate(<x>, by=<list>, FUN=<function>)
- ~x~ is usually a data frame
- ~by~ -> list of grouping elements, each as long as the variables in data frame
  ~x~, or a formula
  - the elements are coerced to factors

Calculate various summary statistics for ~x~ depending on its /class/:
: summary(<x>, …)
- numeric vec.: min/max, median, mean, 1st./3rd. quartile
- logical vec.: count of ~TRUE~ and ~FALSE~
- other vec.: count of elements
- factor: count for each level
- data frame: summary for each variable


Custom functions:

Calculate the standard errors of means of ~x~:
: stdError <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))


Examples:
#+begin_src R
tapply(c("A","B","C","D","E","F"),
       list(c("x","x","z","y","y","z"), c(1,2,1,1,2,2)), paste)
#   1   2
# x "A" "B"
# y "D" "E"
# z "C" "F"
#+end_src


* Logical operators

Exact equality:
: < : <= : > : >= : ==
Inequality:
: !=

Intersection (“and”):
: x & y

Union (“or”):
: x | y

* String manipulation

Create with double or single quotes (always printed ~"…"~).

Escape with C-style escape sequences (~\~ as escape character).
- ~\\~ => ~\~, ~\"~ => ~"~
- ~\n~ => newline, ~\t~ => tab, ~\b~ => backspace
- for a full list, see: ~?Quotes~

Count number of characters:
: nchar(<str>)

Concatenate strings or vector(s) of strings:
: paste(<obj1>, <obj2>, …, ?sep=<str>, ?collapse=<str>)
- default separator is a /space/
- coerces numbers into character strings

Examples:
: paste(c('a','b','c'), c(1,2), collapse=' | ', sep='.')
: => [1] "a.1 | b.2 | c.1"

* Reading/writing data

Read a file in table format and create a data frame from it:
: read.table(↓)
:   file <path> ::string
- : can be absolute or relative to the working directory
:   ?header = FALSE ::bool
- : does the file have a header line?
:   ?sep = "" ::string
- : column-seperator in the input (e.g. ~","~ or ~";"~)
:   ?colClasses = NA ::charvec
- : class of each column in the dataset (e.g. numeric, logical, etc.)
:   ?nrows = -1 ::int
- : number of rows in the dataset
:   ?comment.char = "#" ::string
- : comment character
:   ?skip = 0 ::int
- : number of lines to skip from the beginning
:   ?stringsAsFactors = FALSE ::bool
- : should character variables be coded as factors?
without specialization, R will automatically:
- figure out how many rows there are
- figure out what type of variable is in each column
- however, it will run faster if specified up front
Specialized functions:
: read.csv(…, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"",
:             dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "")

Set ~colnames~ attribute after import to create more readable column names.

Read/write tabular data:
: read.table(…)
: write.table(…)

Read/write lines of a text file:
: readLines(…)
- returns a character vector
: writeLines(…)

Read/write R code files:
: source(…)
: dump(…)

Read/write R code files:
: dget(…)
: dput(…)

Read/write a single R objects in binary form:
: unserialize(…)
: serialize(…)

* Plots / Graphs

Default scatterplot function:
: plot(x, y, ?main=<str>, ?xlab=<str>, ?ylab=<str>, …)

Change the title of a plot:
: title(main = <str>)

Save a plot image:
: quartz.save(<filepath>, …)

Make a grid for plots:
: par(mfrow = c(<rows>, <cols>))


Histogram:
: hist(x, …)

Conditioning plot:
: coplot(formula, …)

Barplot:
: barplot(formula, …)


** Hmisc package

Plot error bars from a mean variable:
: errbar(x, y, yplus, yminus, ?xlab=<str>, ?ylab=<str>, …)
- e.g. ~yplus = y + sd, yminus = y - sd~ (where ~y~ is the mean and ~sd~ is the
  standard deviation or standard error)

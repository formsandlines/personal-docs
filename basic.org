* Program

ctrl-c to interrupt.

Write an ~instruction~ to line ~n~:
: <n> <instruction>

Enter 2 lines in 1 by separation with colon ~:~.

Run the program:
: RUN

Delete from memory:
: NEW

Go to line ~n~:
: GOTO <n>

Comments (remarks):
: REM …

*Note:* Applesoft BASIC had no ~RENUM~ command! (third-party utilities?)

* Subroutines

To go to the subroutine:
: GOSUB <address>

Write the subroutine instructions from that ~address~ on and then a ~RETURN~ line
to return from the subroutine.

To return to the calling line:
: RETURN

* Control structures

: IF <condition> THEN <instruction>

* Loops

Use ~GOTO~ for loops.

: FOR <index-var> = <from-int> TO <to-int>
: <instruction>
: …
: NEXT <index-var>

* Data structures

Initialize an array:
: DIM <name>(<size>)

Access an array index:
: <name>(<index>)

* Output

Clear the screen:
: HOME

Print the program:
: LIST

Print a string:
: PRINT <string>
- join string values with semicolon ~;~

* Memory

Access a memory address:
: PEEK(<address>)

Write to a memory address:
: POKE(<address>) (?)

* Variables

: LET <varname> = <value>

* Text

Put a character horizontally/vertically on the screen:
: HTAB <xpos> : VTAB <ypos>

* Graphic mode

Enter graphics mode:
: GR
Enter high-resolution graphics mode:
: HGR

Return to text mode:
: TEXT

# Personal Docs

These are my personal documentations on various programming languages or libraries/frameworks that Iâ€™ve been learning as well as other things that I need(ed) to look up from time to time.

Note that I have a pretty bad long-term memory, so while it might appear overly diligent or redundant to others, this stuff is essential for my daily work, so I back it up here to have access to my docs whenever or wherever I need to.

Since the structure and content of these docs match my personal mental model and organization, you may not find them very useful for yourself. You should also not rely on what I have written since it may turn out that I got it wrong or made a spelling mistake somewhere (you may file an _Issue_ if you like).

But maybe it inspires you to create your own personal docs that matches _your_ way of thinking and helps you to efficiently look things up, without ever having to remember where to find that specific piece of information that you learned about earlier. I really recommend it. It also helps me to learn if I write down and explicitly (re)organize my knowledge.

For me, _Org mode_ (Emacs) has been the most useful tool for personal docs, but you may prefer something like Markdown. It lets me see the heading structure of my docs at a glance and I can conveniently expand and collapse sub-sections and move around quickly. Viewing my docs with a normal text editor or on GitHub is possible, but somewhat painful.

**Note:** There are a few images from various public websites linked locally in my docs. Links to their sources have been included in all those places and I will continue to include them. If you find the source of your own image incorrectly mentioned or want to have it removed from the repo, please let me know.

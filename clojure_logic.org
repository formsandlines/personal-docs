* Library

** : (run* [q & lvars] & goals)

Executes goals until results are exhausted.

** : (run n [q & lvars] & goals)

Executes goals until a maximum of ~n~ results are found.

** : (== u v)

A goal that attempts to unify terms ~u~ and ~v~.

** : (conde & clauses)

Logical disjunction of the clauses.
- each clause is a series of at least one goal composed in conjunction
- conde succeeds for each clause that succeeds, independently

** : (fresh [& lvars] & goals)

Creates fresh variables. Goals occuring within form a logical conjunction.


* Concepts

** Logical variables (lvars)

** Goals

- either succeeed, fail or have no value
